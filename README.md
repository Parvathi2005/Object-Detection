# Object-Detection
Developed an advanced object detection system using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) to identify and classify objects in real-time video streams with high accuracy. 
Implemented the model in Python using OpenCV and TensorFlow, trained on the COCO dataset (80 classes), and optimized hyperparameters to achieve 85%+ mean average precision (mAP).
The system demonstrates practical applications in surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and retail analytics, showcasing robust performance in dynamic environments.
